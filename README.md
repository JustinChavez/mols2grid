# molgrid

molgrid is a chemical viewer for 2D structures of small molecules

![Demo showing molgrid's integration in a Jupyter notebook](demo.png)

## Usage
---

You can setup the grid from a pandas DataFrame or an SDF file:

```python
from molgrid import MolGrid

# pandas, must contain a SMILES column
mg = MolGrid(df)

# SDF
mg = MolGrid.from_sdf("/path/to/molecules.sdf")
```

There are currently 2 templates available:
  * `pages`, the default, which is displayed above. It integrates nicely with notebooks
  * `table`, which displays the full list of molecules (no pages). Useful if you ever need to print the full list of molecules on paper (or print to PDF)
